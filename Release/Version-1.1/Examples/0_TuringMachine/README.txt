Name
	Consensus/Release/Version-1.1/Examples/0_TuringMachine/TM.story

Usage
	../../B% TM.story < Turing.Machine

Description
	Implements a Turing Machine[1] using the Consensus B% programming language.

	This example features TM.story as the full B% program (aka. story in Consensus
	terms) allowing to read in and execute a Turing Machine, thereby demonstrating
	the Turing completeness of the language.

	The Turing.Machine file features the machine from Lin and Rado which is given
	as example[1].

	See Also the Test sub-directory of the same example sub-directory of the
	Consensus/Release/Version-1.0 release, which features intermediate versions
	of the final TM.story.
