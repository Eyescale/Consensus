Execution Model / Narrative Registry
	The specs are a pre-requisite for most of the planned features implementation below.

File Format extensions
	1. line continuation	\  
		like this	// note that there can be space after backslash
	2. support % and * as standalone expression terms
		currently * is not supported as last character in expression (why?)
	3. single-character identifier entities - e.g. '\0', '(', '\xhh...' etc.
		cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C
		=> modify input, output and expression traversal
	4. registry variable %?
	4.1. pre-requisite: narrative registry
	4.2.
		on ?: expression
		in ?: expression
		%?
	5. narrative definition
	5.1. pre-requisite: execution model / narrative registry
	5.2. modify readNarrative to generate list of narratives, instead of one
	5.3.
		: prototype	// Q: what if base narrative? can I have %argv there?
		this		// Q: what if base narrative?
		%arg		// replace later occurrences of %arg with %(this:exponent)
				// Q: what if base narrative?
		.variable	// replace later occurrence of variable with (this,variable)
				// Q: what if base narrative?
		%( )		// declaration: does nothing
		do .( expr )	// same as do ( this, (expr) )
				// Q: what if base narrative?

		=> Q: what if base narrative?

Input/Output interface
		do expression : "format" <	// input
		do > "format": expression	// output
	1. single-character identifier entities (default)
	2. "%c" in format

	Q: how to convert a ( list, * ) of single character identifier entities
	   into a standalone entity? could it be by piping output into input?
