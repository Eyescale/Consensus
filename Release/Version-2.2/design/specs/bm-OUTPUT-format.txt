	B% output format specification

Description
	%s	output entity's "contents" as string of characters
			STE => _	in case of "_"
			SCE => as-is	e.g. / in case of '/'
			RI  => (_,_)	in case of (_,_)
			       {_,_}	in case of multiple results

	%_	output entity's B%-readable "identifier"
			STE => "_"
			SCE => '_'	in case of separator
			       as-is	in case of non-separator
			RI  => (_,_)	relationship instance
			       {_,_}	in case of multiple results

	$	special case
			%((?,...)_)	concatenates match.sub[1] as %s
			other		same as %s, except concatenates in case
					of multiple results - that is: no {_,_}
					e.g. in case of %(s,?:...)

		Note: as db_outputf() format specifier %$ allows to output
		strings as is (since %s is used for CNDB entities) as well
		as STE keys - as opposed to the referenced string
			

	^	internal only
		db_outputf() invokes xpn_out()


*RI: Relationship Instance(s)
