Name
	Consensus/Release/Version-2.0/Examples/2_TM.single/TM-single.story

Usage
	../../B% TM-single.story

Description
	Implements a Turing Machine[1] using the Consensus B% programming language.

	This example features TM-single.story as a full B% program (aka. story in
	Consensus terms) allowing to read in and execute a Turing Machine, thereby
	demonstrating the Turing completeness of the language.

	The example does not use an ini file, so that all the information pertaining
	to its executions is visible from one source - namely the example story.

	The example features the machine from Lin and Rado[1].
