	I turn the *guard* off|on IFF I have a condition, e.g. in that case

		I have a guard:
			init		OFF
			output		ON
			has right cell	ON

	=> the moment this condition is turned OFF, the guard is decommissioned
	=> how come I am still able to perform:

		in "output"
			in "caller has right cell"
				off "output caller's symbol"
					do "call shifts to right cell"
					 > "caller has right cell"
				off &
					do "callout"

	It's possible because "callout" is set by system !!!!! (Wow...)
		which receives the changes
			: "caller has right cell" : OFF
			: "call shifts to right cell" : OFF
		at the same time !!!!!!!!!!!!!
