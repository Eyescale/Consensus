Name
	Consensus Programming Language (B%) version 2.1	[ BETA ]

Usage
	./B% program.story
	./B% -p program.story
	./B% -f file.ini program.story

Description
	The purpose of the B% Version-2.1 development was to complete
	the ./Examples/1_Schematize/yak.story example and demonstrate
	how user input can be turned into useful and B% specifiable
	program data & actions after segmentation.

	This objective required the capability from B% to extract relevant
	sub-sequences from the segmentized input and pass them as arguments
	to appropriate functions* for further processing.

	The NEW ./Examples/4_Yak/yak.bm service package together with
	the NEW ./Examples/5_Dial/dpu-drive.story example effectively
	demonstrate implementation of the targeted capability, based on
	the B% Version-2.1 New Features and Extensions described below.

	*we use the term function here only to characterize the desired
	capability, the notion of service interface better representing
	both the B% execution model and Consensus's generally targeted
	client-server architecture - see ./design/story/func.story for
	a general B% Version-2.1 software architecture & new features
	design overview.
