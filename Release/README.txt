Name
	Consensus - a knowledge management platform for Human Intelligence

Vision
	A world where everyone has equal share, access rights and control of information,
	inasmuch as they are directly affected.

Idea/System
	. Allows everyone to describe, in 'natural' language, their understanding of how
	  things work
	. Allows each person to publish part or all of their descriptions (stories) and to
	  incorporate (map) into their own story part or all of what the others are willing
	  to share, either in real-time or on a case-by-case basis, depending on how this
	  is specified in their own story
	. Uses each person's story as their own interface to the world

Outcome
	. Natural formation and dynamic evolution of communities based on common interests and
	  acceptance of common procedures / language
	. Possibility for each participant to effectively contribute to and thereby influence
	  the evolution of the community, depending on others' adherence to what s/he himself
	  cares to demonstrate
	. Possibility for each participant to navigate, appreciate and decide for themselves,
	  based on what the others care to share
	. Accrued sense of responsibility, interest & control over one's destiny and environment,
	  via others
