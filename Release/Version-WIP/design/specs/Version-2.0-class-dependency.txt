Synopsis
	Consensus B% Version-2.0 classes & dependency diagram

Overview
	We have

		CNProgram:[ story:CNStory, threads:[ active:{CNCell}, new:{CNCell} ] ]

	where
		CNStory:Registry(CNStoryEntry:[ name, narratives:{ CNNarrative } ])
		where
			CNNarrative:[ proto:char*, root:CNOccurrence ]
			where
				CNOccurrence:[ data:[ type, expression ], sub:{CNOccurrence} ]

	and
		CNCell::CNEntity( [ entry:CNStoryEntry, carry:{} ], ctx:BMContext ]
		where
			BMContext:Registry(CNRegisterVariable:[ name, value ])
			where
				BMContextId(ctx): registryLookup( ctx, "" )->value
					BMContextSelf(ctx): BMContextId(ctx)->name
					BMContextParent(ctx): BMContextId(ctx)->value
				BMContextDB(ctx): registryLookup( ctx, "%" )->value
				BMContextPerso(ctx): registryLookup( ctx, "." )->value
				BMContextActive(ctx): registryLookup( ctx, "@" )->value

Description
	Visualizing the CNEntity cell in its entirety we have

		this:CNCell:CNEntity:[
			sub:contents:[
				nucleus:[
					entry,
					carry ],
				ctx ],
			as_sub:connections:[
				to,
				from ] ]

	where
		. the cell's nucleus hosts the cell's CNStory entry (DNA) as well as
		  its progeny (production)
		. the cell's ctx hosts the parameters of the cell's production agent -
		  otherwise known as the cell's DNA/RNA polymerase enzyme
		. the cell's connections to:( this, that ) are connections to cells 
		  this cell potentially subscribes to
		. the cell's connections from:( that, this ) are connections from cells
		  potentially subscribing to this cell
