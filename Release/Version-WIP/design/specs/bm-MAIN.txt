About B% main loop

	Intuitively we would expect the code to be

		do cnOperate(threads); while ( cnSync(threads) );

	Operations however are only actually performed upon cnSync(threads)
	therefore we have
		
		do cnSync(threads); while ( cnOperate(threads) );

	Where
		cnSync() performs
			for all cells active
				invoke bm_context_update( cell )
					mark cell out if DBExitOn()
			for all cells new
				invoke bm_context_init( cell )
				move cell to active

		cnOperate() performs
			for all cells active
				if not cell out
					invoke bm_cell_operate( cell, story )
					move cell->carry to new
				else // cell out
					clip cell from active
			for all cells out
				release cell

			return ((*active)||(*new));

	do exit operation, in particular, which sets DBExitOn(), only takes effect
	during the following cnSync(), where the cell is marked out - via
		[HACK] *BMCellCarry(cell) = (void*) cell // see bm_cell_update()
	- and will only be released at the end of the next cnOperate()
