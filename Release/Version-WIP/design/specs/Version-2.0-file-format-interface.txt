Description
	External Event Narrative Occurrences (EENO) are occurrences
	in the form

		on event < src

	where
		event and src are expressions - see Caveats section below

	The EENO Register Variables %<? and %<! allow subsequent reference,
	by the narrative, to the EENO query results, as

		%<?	representing event - first match
		%<!	representing src - corresponding proxy

Caveats
	Any term of the EENO event and src expressions which requires
	a dereferencing operation - such as

		expression:filter
		%( expression )
		*expression

	will be dereferenced within the narrative instance's own cell's
	CNDB PRIOR to performing the query.

	Such is the limitation imposed, by design, to the Consensus
	B% inter-cell communication protocol, which allows only to
	query the manifested changes - and not one another's internal
	condition.
