Description
	1. Instantiate

	CNCell instances are created upon either one of the following parent
	cell's narrative operations:

		do !! Narrative ( ... )
		do !! Narrative ( ... ) @<
		do !! Narrative ( ... ) ~<

		do : handle : !! Narrative ( ... )
		do : handle : !! Narrative ( ... ) @<
		do : handle : !! Narrative ( ... ) ~<

	The second occurrence within each of these subsets is equivalent to
	the first (default) occurrence, whereby both parent and instantiated
	cell subscribe to each other upon instantiation. This enables them
	to track each other's events (a.k.a. changes) via narrative EENO.

	In addition to creating a CNCell instance, the second subset of
	above-listed occurrences allows a proxy of the instantiated connection
	to be assigned to a local CNDB handle - expression - if the connection
	was instantiated.

	The last occurrence within both subset denotes an occurrence whereby
	parent unsubscribes from its instantiated cell upon instantiation,
	after which neither parent nor child are able to track each other's
	changes - until potentially future explicit connection.

	The very last occurrence in the above list unassigns and releases the
	connection upon instantiation, which leaves the (*,handle) relationship
	instance created but with nothing to show for it - not even via
	on ~((*,handle),?) It is, however, manifested.

	2. Subscribe

	CNCell instantiation involves instantiating connections, which can be
	handled and stored as proxies within a cell's CNDB.

	Proxies can also be communicated from one cell to another, thereby
	allowing a cell to subscribe to another, unrelated cell, provided only
	that it is passed a proxy instance of a connection to that cell by one
	of its connections - or by its parent, at instantiation.

	See example usage in the Narrative this register variable section below.

	3. Unsubscribe

	Same as above, with unsubscribe from instead of subscribe to.

	4. EENO

	External Event Narrative Occurrences (EENO) are occurrences in the form

			on event < src

		where
			event and src are expressions

	See information related to how these expressions are processed prior to
	launching the query in the Caveats section below.

	5. EENO register variables

	The EENO register variables %<? and %<! allow subsequent references to
	the EENO query results to be made by the narrative, using

		%<?	to represent event = first match
		%<!	to represent src = proxy to the corresponding connection

	6. Narrative this register variable

	The Narrative this register variable %% allows a proxy to the narrative's
	current cell->ctx->this CNInstance to be used for comparison - e.g.

		on : connection : ? < .
			// one of my sources just registered a new connection
			in %<?: %%
				// that connection is me
			else in %<?
				// already subscribed
			else
				// subscribe to my source's new connection
				do @< %<?

	7. Narrative parent register variable

	Likewise the Narrative parent register variable .. references a proxy to
	the narrative's parent cell - provided parent did not unsubscribe upon
	instantiation.

Caveats
	Any referencing term of the EENO event and src expressions, such as

		register variable
		expression:filter
		%( expression )
		*expression

	will be dereferenced within the narrative instance's own cell's CNDB
	PRIOR to the query being launched.

	Such is the limitation imposed, by design, to the Consensus B%
	inter-cell communication protocol, in that it allows only to query
	manifested changes - and not one another's internal condition.
