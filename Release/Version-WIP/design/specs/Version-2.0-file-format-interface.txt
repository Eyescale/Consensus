Description
	1. Instantiate

	CNCell instances are created upon one of the following parent cell's
	narrative operations:

		do !! Narrative ( ... )
		do !! Narrative ( ... ) @<
		do !! Narrative ( ... ) ~<

		do : handle : !! Narrative ( ... )
		do : handle : !! Narrative ( ... ) @<
		do : handle : !! Narrative ( ... ) ~<

	The first occurrence within each subset is equivalent to the second,
	whereby both parent and cell subscribe to each other, and therefore are
	able to track each other's events (a.k.a. changes) via narrative EENO.

	The second subset of above-listed occurrences allow to assign a handle
	- expression - to a proxy of the instantiated connection, if it is
	instantiated - see below concerning the very last occurrence.

	The last occurrence within each subset denotes an occurrence whereby
	parent unsubscribes from its instantiated cell upon instantiation,
	after which neither parent nor child are able to track each other
	events (a.k.a. changes) until future explicit connection.

	The very last occurrence unassigns and releases the connection upon
	instantiation, which leaves the (*,handle) relationship instance
	created and manifested, but with nothing to show for it - not even
	via ~((*,handle),?)

	2. Subscribe

	CNCell instantiation instantiates connections, which can be handled,
	transported and stored (as proxy) within a cell's CNDB. It is thereby
	possible for a cell to subscribe to another, unrelated cell, provided
	it is passed a proxy to that cell via one of its connections - or by
	its parent, at instantiation.

	3. Unsubscribe

	Same as above, with unsubscribe from instead of subscribe to.

	4. EENO

	External Event Narrative Occurrences (EENO) are occurrences in the form

			on event < src

		where
			event and src are expressions - see Caveats section below

	5. EENO register variables

	The EENO register variables %<? and %<! allow subsequent reference to be
	made by the narrative to the EENO query results, as

		%<?	representing event - first match
		%<!	representing src - corresponding proxy (resp. *handle)

	6. Narrative this register variable

	The Narrative this register variable %% references a proxy to the
	narrative's current cell->ctx->this CNInstance, to be used for
	comparison - e.g.

		on : connection : ? < .
			// one of my sources just registered a new connection
			in %<?: %%
				// that connection is me
			else in %<?
				// already subscribed
			else
				// subscribe to my source's new connection
				do @< %<?

	7. Narrative parent register variable

	Likewise the Narrative parent register variable .. references a proxy to
	the narrative's parent cell - provided parent did not unsubscribe upon
	instantiation.

Caveats
	Any referencing term of the EENO event and src expressions, such as

		register variables
		expression:filter
		%( expression )
		*expression

	will be dereferenced within the narrative instance's own cell's CNDB
	PRIOR to the query being launched.

	Such is the limitation imposed, by design, to the Consensus B%
	inter-cell communication protocol, in that it allows only to query
	manifested changes - and not one another's internal condition.
