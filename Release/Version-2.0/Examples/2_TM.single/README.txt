Name
	Consensus/Release/Version-2.0/Examples/2_TM.single/TM-single.story

Usage
	../../B% TM-single.story

Description
	Implements a Turing Machine[1] using the Consensus B% programming language.

	This example features TM.story as the full B% program (aka. story in Consensus
	terms) allowing to read in and execute a Turing Machine, thereby demonstrating
	the Turing completeness of the language.

	The Turing.Machine file features the machine from Lin and Rado which is given
	as example[1].
