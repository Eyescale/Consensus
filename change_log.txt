DONE	. change syntax for conditional execution
DONE	. tracked entity released log events (cf test/monitor)
DONE	. replace expression with expression list in variables everywhere
DONE	. Fix bug: monitor event does not output '.'

Mar 9, 2017
DONE	publish code on github
DONE	: variable : .-.->? : [ .-is->toto ]	>>> does not collapse??? should!!
DONE	introduce flag	sub[ count ].result.resolve in expression_solve.c
DONE	Fix:
DONE		consensus$ : titi : [ ?..: . : %[ ??. ] ]
DONE		consensus$ >:%titi
DONE		?..: %[ ??. ]	>>> should be ?..: . : %[ ??. ]
DONE	. Fix bugs below:
DONE		>:%[ ?.. : %? ] returns whole instance (vs. source)
DONE		>:%[ ?.. : ... : %? ] yields different results	(yields the right results!)
DONE	. fix	>:%[ *. ] or >:%[ _. ]	(crash)
DONE	. fix	!! %titi	( fails )
DONE	. Code restructuring
DONE	. Narrative
DONE		. check overwrite beforehand
DONE	. collapse
DONE		. take ~ flag into account
DONE	. output shorty
DONE	. Expression:
DONE		. flags in Parser and in Output
DONE		. support '*' and '_' and '~' in expression
DONE		. complete solve_expression - take_sub_result: do all the comparisons
DONE		. '~' execution / testing
DONE		. special case : ~.
DONE		. debug freeExpression()
DONE		. generalize shorty...
DONE	. ?~ ... (start directly with if not)
DONE	. IMPLEMENT READ_ACTION from narrative.c
DONE	. >:%narrative()
DONE	. : identifier : %[ expression ]
DONE	. IMPLEMENT PUSH_ACTION from narrative.c
DONE	. read narrative event
DONE	. narrative variables
DONE	. ADD RULE: exit can only be performed during narrative execution, and not in instruction block
DONE	. rewrite frame traversing narrative's internal structure
DONE	. narrative removal at init
DONE	. read narrative from file - done ":<%( "cat file" )"
DONE	. narrative output
DONE		. output actions using command.c
DONE	. ADD RULE: No more ON after ON-IN
DONE	. ADD RULE: init can not be followed by any other event (but can be preceded and/or followed by conditions...)
DONE	. ADD RULE: no "on init" after then
DONE	. narrative cleanup at exit - or right after popping...
DONE	. allow actions without event - write correct pipeline
