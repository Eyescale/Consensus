	./Examples/TuringMachine

Usage
	./B% TM.story < Turing.Machine

Description
	Implements a Turing Machine[1] using the Consensus B% programming language.

	This example features TM.story as the full B% program (aka. story in Consensus
	terms) allowing to read in and execute a Turing Machine, thereby demonstrating
	the Turing completeness of the language.

	The Turing.Machine file features the machine from Lin and Rado which is given
	as example[1].

	The Test sub-directory features intermediate versions of the final TM.story.
	The story Test/TM.4.verbose, akin to a 'debug' version, is intended to
	facilitate understanding of the program.
