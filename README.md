# Consensus

	. This here is a very early version of Consensus
	. To compile, you need to create a .ofiles directory
	. To run, just launch ./consensus
	. after the prompt, you can type e.g. the command

	  consensus$ :<%( "cat test/full" )

	. that should get you started!
	. documentation is under way...
